"""
Given an integer number of seconds, return a string representing the same duration in the format "H:MM:SS", where "H" is the number of hours, "MM" is the number of minutes, and "SS" is the number of seconds.
Return the time using the following rules:
- Seconds: Should always be two digits.
- Minutes: Should omit leading zeros when they aren't needed. Use "0" if the duration is less than one minute.
- Hours: Should be included only if they're greater than zero.
