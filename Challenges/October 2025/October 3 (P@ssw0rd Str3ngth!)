"""
Given a password string, return "weak", "medium", or "strong" based on the strength of the password.

A password is evaluated according to the following rules:
- It is at least 8 characters long.
- It contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- It contains at least one number.
- It contains at least one special character from this set: !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, or *.

Return "weak" if the password meets fewer than two of the rules.
Return "medium" if the password meets 2 or 3 of the rules.
Return "strong" if the password meets all 4 rules.
