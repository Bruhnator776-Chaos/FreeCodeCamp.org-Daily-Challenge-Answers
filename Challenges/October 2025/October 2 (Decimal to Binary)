"""
Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number.
To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder.
Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first.
