"""
Given a string representing a binary number, return its decimal equivalent as a number.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number.
To convert binary to decimal, multiply each digit by a power of 2 and add them together.
Start by multiplying the rightmost digit by 2^0, the next digit to the left by 2^1, and so on.
Once all digits have been multiplied by a power of 2, add the result together.
