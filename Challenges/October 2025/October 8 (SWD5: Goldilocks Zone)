"""
For the fifth day of Space Week, you will calculate the "Goldilocks zone" of a star - the region around a star where conditions are "just right" for liquid water to exist.
Given the mass of a star, return an array with the start and end distances of its Goldilocks Zone in Astronomical Units.

To calculate the Goldilocks Zone:
- Find the luminosity of the star by raising its mass to the power of 3.5.
- The start of the zone is 0.95 times the square root of its luminosity.
- The end of the zone is 1.37 times the square root of its luminosity.
- Return the distances rounded to two decimal places.
