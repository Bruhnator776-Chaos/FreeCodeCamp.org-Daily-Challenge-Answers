"""
Given the current temperature of a room in Fahrenheit and a target temperature in Celsius, return a string indicating how to adjust the room temperature based on these constraints:
- Return "Heat: X degrees Fahrenheit" if the current temperature is below the target.
  - With X being the number of degrees in Fahrenheit to heat the room to reach the target, rounded to 1 decimal place.
- Return "Cool: X degrees Fahrenheit" if the current temperature is above the target.
  - With X being the number of degrees in Fahrenheit to cool the room to reach the target, rounded to 1 decimal place.
- Return "Hold" if the current temperature is equal to the target.

To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the Celsius temperature by 1.8 and add 32 to the result (F = (C * 1.8) + 32).
