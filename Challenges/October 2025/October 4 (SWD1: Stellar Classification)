"""
For today's challenge, you are given the surface temperature of a star in Kelvin (K) and need to determine its stellar classification based on the following ranges:

- "O": 30,000 K or higher
- "B": 10,000 K - 29,999 K
- "A": 7,500 K - 9,999 K
- "F": 6,000 K - 7,499 K
- "G": 5,200 K - 5,999 K
- "K": 3,700 K - 5,199 K
- "M": 0 K - 3,699 K

Return the classification of the given star.
