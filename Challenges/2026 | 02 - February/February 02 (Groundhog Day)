"""
Today is Groundhog Day, in which a groundhog predicts the weather based on whether or not it sees its shadow.

Given a value representing the groundhog's appearance, return the correct prediction:
- If the given value is the boolean true (the groundhog saw its shadow), return "Looks like we'll have six more weeks of winter.".
- If the value is the boolean false (the groundhog did not see its shadow), return "It's going to be an early spring.".
- If the value is anything else (the groundhog did not show up), return "No prediction this year.".
