"""
Given distance points, style points, a wind compensation value, and K-point bonus value, calculate your score for the ski jump and determine if you won a medal or not.

Your score is calculated by summing the above four values.

The current total scores of the other jumpers are:
- [165.5, 172.0, 158.0, 180.0, 169.5, 175.0, 162.0, 170.0]

- If your score is the best, return "Gold"
- If it's second best, return "Silver"
- If it's third best, return "Bronze"
- Otherwise, return "No Medal"
