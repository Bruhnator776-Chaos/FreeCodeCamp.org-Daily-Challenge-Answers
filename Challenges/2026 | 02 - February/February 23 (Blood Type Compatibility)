"""
Given a donor blood type and a recipient blood type, determine whether the donor can give blood to the recipient.

Each blood type consists of:
- A letter: "A", "B", "AB", or "O"
- And an Rh factor: "+" or "-"

Blood types will be one of the valid letters followed by an Rh factor.

Letter Rules:
- "O" can donate to other letter type.
- "A" can donate to "A" and "AB".
- "B" can donate to "B" and "AB".
- "AB" can donate only to "AB".

Rh Rules:
- Negative ("-") can donate to both "-" and "+".
- Positive ("+") can donate only to "+".

Both letter and Rh rule must pass for a donor to be able to donate to the recipient.
