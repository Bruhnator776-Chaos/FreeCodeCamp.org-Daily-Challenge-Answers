"""
Given an array of 6 ice hockey teams and their records after the round robin games, determine the match-ups for the semi-final round.

Each array item will have a team and their record in the format "TEAM: W-OTW-OTL-L". Where:
- "W" is the number of wins in regulation, worth 3 points each
- "OTW" is the number of overtime wins, worth 2 points each
- "OTL" is the number of overtime losses, worth 1 point each
- "L" is the number of losses, worth 0 points each

Find the total number of points for each team and return "The semi-final games will be (1st) vs (4th) and (2nd) vs (3rd)."
