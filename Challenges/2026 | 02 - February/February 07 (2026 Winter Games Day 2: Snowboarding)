"""
Given a snowboarder's starting stance and a rotation in degrees, determine their landing stance.

- A snowboarder's stance is either "Regular" or "Goofy".
- Trick rotations are multiples of 90 degrees. Positive indicates clockwise rotation, and negative indicate counter-clockwise rotation.
- The landing stance flips every 180 degrees of rotation.
