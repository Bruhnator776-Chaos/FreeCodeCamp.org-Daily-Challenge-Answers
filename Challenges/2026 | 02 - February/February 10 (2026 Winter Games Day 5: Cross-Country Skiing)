"""
Given an array of finish times for a cross-country ski race, convert them into times behind the winner.

- Given times are strings in "H:MM:SS" format.
- Given times will be in order from fastest to slowest.
- The winners time (fastest time) should correspond to "0".
- Each other time should show the time behind the winner, in the format "+M:SS".
