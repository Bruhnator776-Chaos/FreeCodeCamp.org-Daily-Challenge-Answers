"""
Given an array representing the weights of the athletes on a bobsled team and a number representing the weight of the bobsled, determine whether the team is eligible to race.

- The length of the array determines the team size: 1, 2 or 4 person teams.
- All given weight values are in kilograms (kg).

The bobsled (sled by itself) must have a minimum weight of:
- 162 kg for a 1-person team
- 170 kg for a 2-person team
- 210 kg for a 4-person team

The total weight of the bobsled (athletes plus sled) must not exceed:
- 247 kg for a 1-person team
- 390 kg for a 2-person team
- 630 kg for a 4-person team

Return "Eligible" if the team meets all the requirements, or "Not Eligible" if the team fails to meet one or more of the requirements.
