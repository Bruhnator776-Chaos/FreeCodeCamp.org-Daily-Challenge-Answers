"""
Given the snow depth and slope of a mountain, determine if there's an avalanche risk.

The snow depth values are:
- "Shallow"
- "Moderate"
- "Deep"

Slope values are:
- "Gentle"
- "Steep"
- "Very Steep"

Return "Safe" or "Risky" based on this table:
                    "Shallow"	"Moderate"	"Deep"
    "Gentle"	    "Safe"	    "Safe"	    "Safe"
    "Steep"	        "Safe"	    "Risky"	    "Risky"
    "Very Steep"    "Safe"	    "Risky"	    "Risky"
