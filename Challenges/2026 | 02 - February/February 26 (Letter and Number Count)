"""
Given a string, return a message with the count of how many letters and numbers it contains.

- Letters are A-Z and a-z.
- Numbers are 0-9.
- Ignore all other characters.

Return "The string has X letters and Y numbers.", where "X" is the count of letters and "Y" is the count of numbers.

If either count is 1, use the singular form for that item.
