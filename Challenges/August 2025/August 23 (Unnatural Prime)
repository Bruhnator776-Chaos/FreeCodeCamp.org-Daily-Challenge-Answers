"""
Given an integer, determine if that number is a prime number or a negative prime number.

- A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
- A negative prime number is the negative version of a positive prime number.
- 1 and 0 are not considered prime numbers.
