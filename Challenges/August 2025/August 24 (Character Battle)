"""
Given two strings representing your army and an opposing army, each character from your army battles the character at the same position from the opposing army using the following rules:
- Characters a-z have a strength of 1-26, respectively.
- Characters A-Z have a strength of 27-52, respectively.
- Digits 0-9 have a strength of their face value.
- All other characters have a value of zero.
- Each character can only fight one battle.

For each battle, the stronger character wins. The army with more victories, wins the war. Return the following values:
- "Opponent retreated" if your army has more characters than the opposing army.
- "We retreated" if the opposing army has more characters than yours.
- "We won" if your army won more battles.
- "We lost" if the opposing army won more battles.
- "It was a tie" if both armies won the same number of battles.
