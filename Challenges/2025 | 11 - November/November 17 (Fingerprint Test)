"""
Given two strings representing fingerprints, determine if they are a match using the following rules:
- Each fingerprint will consist only of lowercase letters (a-z).
- Two fingerprints are considered a match if:
  - They are the same length.
  - The number of differing characters does not exceed 10% of the fingerprint length.
