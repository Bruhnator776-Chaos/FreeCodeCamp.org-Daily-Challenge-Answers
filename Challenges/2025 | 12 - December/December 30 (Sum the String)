"""
Given a string containing digits and other characters, return the sum of all numbers in the string.

- Treat consecutive digits as a single number.
- Ignore any non-digit characters.

# CODE #

def string_sum(s):
    if s.isnumeric(): return int(s) # If there are no letters in the string, return the number
    total, s = 0, s+"a" # Create a variable to hold the total. The s is a band-aid solution to an error in the code. If the argument given ends with a digit, it doesn't count the last number in the string, for example, a1b20c300 would result in 21 instead of 321, because it would ignore 300. To fix that, a single letter is added to the end of the string.
    while True: # While True...
        try: # Attempt to...
            current_num = "" # Set the current_num to an empty string
            while not s[0].isnumeric(): s = s[1:] # Remove every non-numerical digit at the beginning of the string
            while s[0].isnumeric(): # While the first character of the string is a number...
                current_num += s[0] # Add the first character of the string to the current_num
                s = s[1:] # Remove the first character of the string
            total += int(current_num) # Add the current_num to the total
