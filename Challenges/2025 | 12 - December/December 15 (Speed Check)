Given the speed you are traveling in miles per hour (MPH), and a speed limit in kilometers per hour (KPH), determine whether you are speeding and if you will get a warning or a ticket.

- 1 mile equals 1.60934 kilometers.
- If you are travelling less than or equal to the speed limit, return "Not Speeding".
- If you are travelling 5 KPH or less over the speed limit, return "Warning".
- If you are travelling more than 5 KPH over the speed limit, return "Ticket".
