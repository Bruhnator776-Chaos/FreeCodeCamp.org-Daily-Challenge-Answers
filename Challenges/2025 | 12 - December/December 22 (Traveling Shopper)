"""
Given an amount of money you have, and an array of items you want to buy, determine how many of them you can afford.

- The given amount will be in the format ["Amount", "Currency Code"].
- Each array item you want to purchase will be in the same format.

Use the following exchange rates to convert values:

    Currency	1 Unit Equals
      USD      	  1.00 USD
      EUR   	  1.10 USD
      GBP	      1.25 USD
      JPY	      0.0070 USD
      CAD   	  0.75 USD

- If you can afford all the items in the list, return "Buy them all!".
- Otherwise, return "Buy the first X items.", where X is the number of items you can afford when purchased in the order given.
