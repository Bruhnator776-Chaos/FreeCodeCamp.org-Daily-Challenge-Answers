"""
Given a string that includes a blockquote in Markdown, return the equivalent HTML string.

A blockquote in Markdown is any line that:
- Starts with zero or more spaces
- Followed by a greater-than sign (>)
- Then, one or more spaces
- And finally, the blockquote text.

Return the blockquote text surrounded by opening and closing HTML blockquote tags.

# CODE #

def parse_blockquote(markdown): return "<blockquote>"+markdown.strip()[1:].lstrip()+"</blockquote>"

"""
The above code takes the string and removes the whitespace around the string, removes the first character (The ">"), then removes the whitespace that was between the ">" and the first non-whitespace character. This modified string is then placed between HTML blockquote tags and returned.
