"""
Given a 2D array representing the inventory of your store, and another 2D array representing a shipment you have received, return your updated inventory.

- Each element in the arrays will have the format: [quantity, "item"], where quantity is an integer and "item" is a string.
- Update items in the inventory by adding the quantity of any matching items from the shipment.
- If a received item does not exist in the current inventory, add it as a new entry to the end of the inventory.
- Return inventory in the order it was given with new items at the end in the order they appear in the shipment.
