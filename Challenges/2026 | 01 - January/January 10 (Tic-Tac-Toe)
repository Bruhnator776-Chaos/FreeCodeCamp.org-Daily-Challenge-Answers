"""
Given a 3x3 matrix (an array of arrays) representing a completed Tic-Tac-Toe game, determine the winner.

- Each element in the given matrix is either an "X" or "O".

A player wins if they have three of their characters in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Return:
- "X wins" if player X has three in a row.
- "O wins" if player O has three in a row.
- "Draw" if no player has three in a row.
