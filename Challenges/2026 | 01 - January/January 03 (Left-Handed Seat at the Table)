"""
Given a 4x2 matrix (array of arrays) representing the seating arrangement for a meal, determine how many seats a left-handed person can sit at.

- A left-handed person cannot sit where a right-handed person would be in the seat to the immediate left of them.

In the given matrix:
- An "R" is a seat occupied by a right-handed person.
- An "L" is a seat occupied by a left-handed person.
- A "U" is an unoccupied seat.
- Only unoccupied seats are available to sit at.
- The seats in the top row are facing "down", and the seats in the bottom row are facing "up" (like a table), so left and right are relative to the seat's orientation.
- Corner seats only have one seat next to them.
"""

# CODE #

def find_left_handed_seats(table): return ("".join(table[0]) + "".join(table[1])).count("U") - ("".join(table[0][::-1]) + " " + "".join(table[1])).count("RU")

"""
Here's a basic breakdown of how the above code works:
  1) Take a count of all the unnocupied seats at the table
  2) Take a count of each spot at the table in which a Left-Handed person couldn't sit
  3) Subtract the value from step 2 from step 1
