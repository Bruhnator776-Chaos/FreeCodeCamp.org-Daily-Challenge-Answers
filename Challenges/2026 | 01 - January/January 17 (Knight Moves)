"""
Given the position of a knight on a chessboard, return the number of valid squares the knight can move to.

A standard chessboard is 8x8, with columns labeled A through H (left to right) and rows labeled 1 through 8 (bottom to top).

It looks like this:
  A8  B8  C8  D8  E8  F8  G8  H8
  A7  B7  C7  D7  E7  F7  G7  H7
  A6  B6  C6  D6  E6  F6  G6  H6
  A5  B5  C5  D5  E5  F5  G5  H5
  A4  B4  C4  D4  E4  F4  G4  H4
  A3  B3  C3  D3  E3  F3  G3  H3
  A2  B2  C2  D2  E2  F2  G2  H2
  A1  B1  C1  D1  E1  F1  G1  H1

A knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical), and one square in the perpendicular direction.

This means a knight can move to up to eight possible positions, but fewer when near the edges of the board.
