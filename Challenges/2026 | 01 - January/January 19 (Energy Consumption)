"""
Given the number of Calories burned during a workout, and the number of watt-hours used by your electronic devices during that workout, determine which one used more energy.

To compare them, convert both values to joules using the following conversions:
- 1 Calorie equals 4184 joules.
- 1 watt-hour equals 3600 joules.

Return:
- "Workout" if the workout used more energy.
- "Devices" if the device used more energy.
- "Equal" if both used the same amount of energy.
