"""
Given the position of one of your pawns on a chessboard, return an array of all the valid squares it can move to in ascending order.

A standard chessboard is 8x8, with columns labeled A through H (left to right) and rows labeled 1 through 8 (bottom to top).

For this challenge:
- You are the player on the bottom of the board.
- Pawns can only move one square "up".
- Unless the pawn is in the starting row (row 2), then it can move one or two squares up.

    else: return [position[0] + str(int(position[1])+1)] # If the pawn is not on the starting row, return the pawns new position given that it stays in the same column and moves one row forward
