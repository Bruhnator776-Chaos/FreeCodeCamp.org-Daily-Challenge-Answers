"""
Given an array of exam scores (numbers), return the average score in form of a letter grade according to the following chart:
    Average Score	Letter Grade
    97-100	      "A+"
    93-96	        "A"
    90-92	        "A−"
    87-89	        "B+"
    83-86	        "B"
    80-82	        "B-"
    77-79	        "C+"
    73–76	        "C"
    70-72	        "C-"
    67-69	        "D+"
    63-66	        "D"
    60–62	        "D-"
    below 60	    "F"

Calculate the average by adding all scores in the array and dividing by the total number of scores.
