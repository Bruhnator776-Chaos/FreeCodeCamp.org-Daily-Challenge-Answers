"""
Given a message string, a secret key string, and a signature number, determine if the signature is valid using this encoding method:
- Letters in the message and secret key have these values:
  - a to z have values 1 to 26 respectively.
  - A to Z have values 27 to 52 respectively.
- All other characters have no value.
- Compute the signature by taking the sum of the message plus the sum of the secret key.

Check if the computed signature matches the provided signature.
