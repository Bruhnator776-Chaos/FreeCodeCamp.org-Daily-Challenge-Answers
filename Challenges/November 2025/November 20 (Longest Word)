"""
Given a sentence string, return the longest word in the sentence.

- Words are separated by a single space.
- Only letters (a-z, case-insensitive) count toward the word's length.
- If there are multiple words with the same length, return the first one that appears.
- Return the word as it appears in the given string, with punctuation removed.
