"""
Given two integers, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers.

# CODE #
def lcm(a, b):
    a = [a*i for i in range(b+1)][1:] # Create a list that holds the multiples of "a" up through a*b
    for num in a: # For each multiple...
        if num//b == num/b: return num
"""
Comment for Line 7:

If the number is divisible by "b," then it therefore must be a multiple of both "a" and "b."
The nums in "a" are in ascending order.
If we return the first multiple of "b" we come across, it will always be the least common multiple.
