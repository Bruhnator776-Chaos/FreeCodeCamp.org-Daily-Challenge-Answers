"""
Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following 4 rules:
1) It contains two or more dashes (-).
2) It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (()). Text can be within the parenthesis.
3) It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.
4) Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (A-Z). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return "AI", otherwise, return "Human".
