Given the size of a fuel tank, the current fuel level, and the price per gallon, return the cost to fill the tank all the way.

- <tankSize> is the total capacity of the tank in gallons.
- <fuelLevel> is the current amount of fuel in the tank in gallons.
- <pricePerGallon> is the cost of one gallon of fuel.
- The returned value should be rounded to two decimal places in the format: "$d.dd".
