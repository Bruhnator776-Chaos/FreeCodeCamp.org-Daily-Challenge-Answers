Given the current temperature of a room and a target temperature, return a string indicating how to adjust the room temperature based on these constraints:
- Return "heat" if the current temperature is below the target.
- Return "cool" if the current temperature is above the target.
- Return "hold" if the current temperature is equal to the target.
