"""
Given an array of numbers representing the speed at which vehicles were observed traveling, and a number representing the speed limit, return an array with two items, the number of vehicles that were speeding, followed by the average amount beyond the speed limit of those vehicles.

- If there were no vehicles speeding, return [0, 0].
